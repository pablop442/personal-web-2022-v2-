                You read right! I am a seasoned legal professional who embarked on an exciting
                journey that led me to the dynamic world of technology.<br></br>
                Eager to dive into this rapidly evolving field, I enrolled in a
                rigorous programming bootcamp, where I honed my skills in
                JavaScript, SQL, Python, and various other programming
                languages. As I delved deeper into the world of coding, I found
                my true calling in the realm of quality assurance (QA) and
                automation testing.
